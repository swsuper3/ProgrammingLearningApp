*Program with Pac-Man!*

This is a programming learning app, by Siem van Opstal and Wieke Boerop.
In this app, the user can practice programming through simple commands (turn, move, repeat) which makes Pac-Man move on a grid!

Users can program without limits in Freeplay, or try one of the Pathfinding Exercises.

A large part of this project regarded planning, testing, and designing the application with the use of various diagrams.
